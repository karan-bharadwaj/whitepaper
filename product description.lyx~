Trading - Post trade life cycle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Securities trading lifecycle is a process which involves a large number
 of steps and stakeholders, which are introduced to mitigate different type
 of risks.
 This process today takes about three days between trade execution and settlemen
t.
 Many market infrastructure institutions have explored the use of blockchain
 technology in this context.
 The trading lifecycle structure can be generalised in the following steps:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Trade execution: in this phase buyer and seller request an order to their
 brokers, who act on clients behalf and submit orders to an exchange.
 When orders are matched, a confirmation is returned to brokers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Trade clearance: details about orders are sent to a clearinghouse, and
 original contract novation takes place.
 At this point clearinghouse acts as buyer to seller and as seller to buyer.
 In this way, clearinghouse will take settlement risk and guarantee trade
 execution for both counter parties.
 In front on that, clearinghouse requests adequate margins to their clearing
 members for mitigating their default risk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Trade settlement: in this phase obligations settlement is performed using
 netting.
 This involves orders grouping into a single transaction leveraging a custodian.
 In the end, buyer sets his obligation with the custodians throughout delivery
 versus payment and sellers get paid.
 The entire trading process is made considerably more complex due to coordinatio
n between multiple necessary stakeholders.
 By adopting a shared distributed ledger platform, stakeholders could be
 eliminating the need for replication and duplication of the same data.
 As a consequence there will be reduced error rates, increased speed and
 cut cost associated with reconciliation and management of data.
 Speeding up the process of assets changing hands would result in lower
 capital requirements because there will be lower operational and counterpart
 risks.

Integrating the Blocktensor BlockChain 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application of Blocktensor smart contracts along with the blockchain
 technology will allow the creation of any kind of token into the blockchain
 itself so that bonds, shares and other financial instruments can be represented.
 One possibility to simplify existing process is to represent securities
 and perform post-trade lifecycle on blockchain.
 Clearing and settlement will happen on blockchain, which will also be the
 depository for the assets.
 In this view, order matching is still done off-chain and then a clearinghouse
 can perform novation and split orders in a sell order with the original
 buyer and a buy order with the original seller.
 The entire process, as well as informations and rules representing securities
 will be encoded in smart contracts.
 Let us consider a smart contract between a clearinghouse and a buyer.
 The clearinghouse will issue this contract once the trade is matched which
 will have the following methods to interact with the buyer: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Securities Order Details Method: information about type, amount and securities
 rules can be requested by the buyer to review the order.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Settlement Method: the buyer can call this method to pay the clearinghouse
 and receive securities.
 Settlement is triggered only if the buyer has the necessary funds.
 This may happen with the current DVP (Delivery Versus Payment).
 In order to perform the payment, the buyer must have an account on the
 blockchain with adequate amount of funds.
 In case the buyer has not got enough funds on his account, a call to the
 DVP method would return an error and securities would not be settled.
 Other features can be added: the clearing- house can for example set a
 timeframe in which DVP can be executed or create margin accounts for clearing
 members, with custom rules defined in smart contracts.
 This solution reduces clearing and settlement time from days to minutes.
 Furthermore, blockchain acts either as both clearing and settlement platform
 eliminating the need for reconciliation among different actors.
 Contract terms execution throughout code reduces back office workload and
 risk of errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Brokers - which would have blockchain accounts and place orders for their
 clients in form of smart contracts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Clients among which payments can be done directly throughout accounts
 registered on the blockchain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Clearing firms - which can manage client identity through a KYC registry
 and would request brokers the margin requirements for trading activity.A
 private permissioned blockchain in which nodes are controlled by a consortium
 composed by brokers and clearing firms is considered.
 The agents can put orders on the blockchain using the smart contracts,
 which automatically handle trading matching, execution and the terms of
 the contract.
 This solution will effectively reduce the reconciliation time and complexities
 while coordinating with the multiple stakeholders in the securities post
 trading lifecycle.
 Also, there will be significantly less capital requirement with lesser
 risk involved and no intermediaries present
