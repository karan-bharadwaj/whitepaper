<Blocktensor> created by Chainframe is a distributed ledger designed as
 a secure, scalable, and cost effective backend for carrying out financial
 transactions.
 Designed as a permissioned or private blockchain, the visibility of the
 transactions to any parties involved is completely customize-able.
 This is unlike in public blockchains such as Bitcoin where transactional
 data is visible to all.
 Using state of the art cryptographic techniques, transactions are secured
 using the SHA256 standard and they are transferred between distributed
 nodes using SSL.
 <Blocktensor> is aimed at financial industries that typically have high
 volume transactional data flow.
 Using network consensus mechanisms tailored for permissioned blockchains,
 <Blocktensor> is an extremely scalable solution for high volume requirements.
 Easily deployed on the cloud or a combination of the two, <Blocktensor>'s
 blockchain network can be set up quickly and cheaply.

Commercial Offerings:

\begin_layout Standard
There are three major classes of setup offerings provided by <placeholder>.
 The first offering is where <placeholder> installs the necessary server
 hardware at appropriate geographic locations to serve as networking nodes
 for the distributed ledger.
 The second offering is where the individual nodes are set up on a cloud
 service like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.
 An expected concern with this particular implementation is the physical
 location of the data.
 Due to the sensitive nature of financial data, and the regulatory demands
 to locate cloud server farms physically in India,

Scenario 1: Our goal is to make massive changes to the infrastructure of
 the banking institution in general.

Scenario 2: We work on the premise that any new digital offering is built
 from the ground up using our blockchain.

Another important facet is whether we want to digitize existing workflows
 OR we want to create new workflows in accordance with new functionality.

Privacy:

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of privacy afforded by blockchain technology is often misunderstood
 and sometimes misused.
 In the case of permissionless or public blockchains, like Bitcoin, the
