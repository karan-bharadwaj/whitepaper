Understanding the Blockchain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the past few years, an important innovation colloquially known as the
 “blockchain” has emerged as a potentially disruptive technology.
 The core of the innovation is built around the concept of a distributed
 cryptographic database.
 The database, also referred to as the ledger, is maintained by a network
 of computers.
 The ledger makes it possible for the entire network to create, evolve and
 keep track of an immutable record of transactions.
 The most successful blockchain application thus far has been Satoshi Nakamoto's
 cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin, which he outlined in his seminal paper,
 “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” in 2008.
 This powerful technology has so far been been implicated in the numerous
 unregulated cyrptocurrencies that exist online.
 Financial institutions are only beginning to understand the potential applicati
ons of blockchains in conventionally regulated industries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Distributed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blockchain is also referred to as a distributed ledger.
 This is both because a large number of nodes on the blockchain network
 posses their own copy of the entire ledger and that they are connected
 to one another.
 This creates a distributed arrangement of nodes.
 This is an important design choice because when a block of transactions
 is ready to be uploaded onto the blockchain, the individual nodes participate
 in a voting mechanism to decide which node, called the 'leader', makes
 the addition.
 This entire process is based upon a networking paradigm derived from BFT
 or Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithms(see section 1.3.1).
 All nodes in this distributed system have access to a subset of all available
 nodes and are able to re-connect and update their individual ledger in
 the case of any downtime.
 Certain groups of nodes are stable nodes and often given the label 'genesis'
 nodes to demarcate the fact that the first block was created at that particular
 node and shared with other nodes.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Cryptographic Security
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blockchain is designed such that transactions are created using public
 key encryption(see section 1.3.2).
 Each account has a private key associated with it.
 The public key derived from the private key is used to sign transactions.
 The private key establishes ownership of the token transferred by the transacti
on.
 The use of public key encryption means that if someone were to get hold
 of the transaction data through malicious means, they would be unable to
 derive any information from it because the private key for any account
 is never exposed.
 The data stays encrypted and is of no use to the attacker.
 There is a second layer of SSL encryption that transfers the transaction
 data between nodes.
 So complete privacy is guaranteed at both the level of transaction data
 as well as the transmission of the transaction data.
 Any entities who must be able to lawfully decrypt the data can be permissioned
 appropriately.
 This could include the payment service players(PSPs), auditors, or agencies
 involved in anti money laundering monitoring.
 Certain observer nodes can be configured for this purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Immutable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As suggested by it's name, the blockchain is a long collection of blocks
 that link to each other in a specific way.
 In most implementations, each new block that is added to the blockchain
 contains a pointer to the previous block called the parent block.
 This pointer is included in a specific area of the block, sometimes called
 the header.
 In the case of the Bitcoin implementation, a block is identified by a SHA256
 hash of the header.
 The header also contains the pointer to the previous block- the previous
 block hash.
 This arrangement links the newly created block with it's parent block and
 so on till the very first block called the genesis block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this arrangement accomplishes is that if someone made an attempt to
 maliciously alter a transaction somewhere in the blockchain, they would
 change the blocks hash.
 Since the block's hash is included in the block following it(the child
 block), they would then have to change the child's hash as well.
 The higher the position of the block that is altered, the more child blocks
 succeeding it have to be altered.
 This quickly becomes an impossible task since new blocks are being added
 constantly and any malicious individual or small group(of nodes) cannot
 compete with the honest nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This gives rise to the property of immutability.
 Which means that the state object, once created, is unchangeable.
 While there are ways to change the blockchain, as in the case of hacks
 or upgrades, these changes are difficult to implement and require structural
 modifications rather than changes to the block transactions themselves
 because of the very same property of immutability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Byzantine Fault Tolerance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Byzantine fault tolerance is a property of computer systems that are faced
 with failures resulting from the Byzantine General's Problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Byzantine General's Problem refers to a hypothetical scenario where
 consensus must be reached between participants.
 The problem statement is that a number of generals of the Byzantine army
 must coordinate their movements on the battlefield.
 The options available to them is to 'attack' or 'retreat'.
 The idea being that a coordinated 'attack' or 'retreat' is better than
 some generals attacking and being defeated and some retreating.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The circumstances are complicated because the generals are separated from
 each other and must send messages to communicate.
 The messengers sent out by the generals might entirely fail in delivering
 the message.
 Or certain generals could be traitorous.
 In such a case where there are nine generals and four apiece vote for 'retreat'
 and 'attack', the ninth general can vote for a losing strategy or perhaps
 send different messages to either group.
 In either scenario the rogue general has compromised the system.
 This analogy holds well for nodes in a distributed network and helps envision
 strategies to create robust fault tolerance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us considers the scenario of three generals A, B, and C, and their exchange
 of messages.
 If we suppose that A is malicious and sends conflicting messages to both
 B and C, then it is impossible for B and C to determine who the traitor
 is given that they can communicate with each other.
 One conclusion to draw from this is that the number of nodes that are faulty
 must be less than a third of the total number of nodes.
 In other words, the strength of an algorithm that can deal with Byzantine
 Faults is measured in terms of the number of faulty nodes or processes
 it can tolerate.

Byzantine Fault Tolerance
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of implementations of Byzantine Fault Tolerance in practice
 today.
 Proof-of-work is a very well established implementation of Byzantine Fault
 Tolerance used in public blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
 A derivative of the network consensus algorithm Raft, hardened with fault
 tolerance, has been designed by the JP Morgan team which created the permission
ed blockchain called Juno.
 The Ripple consensus algorithm is another implementation of Byzantine Fault
 Tolerance in the context of permissioned blockchains used most notably
 by the Intel Sawtooth blockchain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Public Key cryptography
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Public key or asymmetric cryptography is a sub-field of information theory
 that underpins much of modern day computer security.
 The mathematical underpinning of public key cryptography lies in families
 of mathematical functions that are injective and irreversible.
 A function that is injective or one-to-one, maps an input to a unique output.
 So functions of this nature will never have multiple inputs pointing to
 one output or vice versa.
 This is a prerequisite for functions used in cryptography.
 The way public key cryptography works is that a key pair containing two
 keys, private and public, are generated for an account.
 The public key for that account is used to encrypt transactions transferring
 tokens into the account.
 The private key is used to decrypt the transactions and allows the owner
 of the account to further spend the tokens.
 This is how the bitcoin blockchain works but there can be differences depending
 on the function family or implementation.
 The other requirement of the mathematical function is called reversibility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematical functions are called irreversible when they are easy to calculate
 in one direction but practically impossible to calculate in the other direction.
 For instance the cryptographic algorithm called RSA necessitates the multiplica
tion of two large primes, which is easy and straightforward to do.
 Getting those two primes from the product, on the other hand, is extremely
 difficult since it requires factoring a very large number.
 RSA is implemented in the SSL protocol that is very commonly used in networking.
 Elliptical curve cryptography uses a different class of functions that
 are less computationally intensive than those used in RSA.
 It has been getting attention from computer security experts as a possible
 replacement for RSA.
 Eleptical curve cryptography is the implementation of choice in Bitcoin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Consensus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The state of a blockchain network is defined as the set of all the accounts
 that it contains.
 Network consensus mechanisms determine the state transition rules that
 determine changes to the state of the network.
 Blockchain networks are prone to Byzantine Faults and originally state
 transition rules were a part of the consensus mechanism.
 Ethereum is a notable exception to this where the state transition rules
 are entirely separate from the consensus mechanism.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three major categories of network consensus that need to be appropriat
ely met by any network algorithm if it is designed to be implemented as
 a consensus mechanism in a blockchain: correctness, agreement, and Utility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Correctness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Correctness refers to the ability of a distributed system to ascertain whether
 transactions carried out are correct or fraudulent.
 In the case traditional financial institutions, a fiduciary network of
 institutions that guarantee trust and the correctness of the transaction
 is established through digital signatures.
 In the context of a distributed system, there is no institution or a group
 of institutions to guarantee trust.
 In fact, in a number of blockchain implementations some or all the members
 may be anonymous.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Agreement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A distributed system has a number of nodes which contribute to maintaining
 the state.
 In other words, the distributed system must have a shared or global truth
 that all nodes can agree on.
 While this concept is related to the idea of correctness, agreement refers
 to the ability of the distributed system to protect against the same correct
 transaction made multiple times.
 This is also referred to as the problem of double spending.
 Double spending was such a big problem that it essentially crippled the
 earliest digital currency ventures.
 It was the bitcoin blockchain that solved what was fundamentally a problem
 of agreement.
 Agreement is the existence of a single global set of recognized transactions
 in the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Utility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A distributed system with the properties of correctness and utility will
 still be unusable if the latency of the network is very high.
 Even with robust correctness and utility, if the settlement time is a week,
 the distributed system cannot be used because of it's impracticability.
 While utility has other components, latency is the most quantitative measure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blockchain is made up of different technologies derived from different
 fields of computer science.
 Consensus mechanisms are derived from computer networking.
 Cryptographic security is derived from information theory.
 The wallet, or where the user interacts with his tokens, lives on different
 devices including smartphones.
 In some paradigms it can be useful to think of the blockchain as a protocol
 that can be implemented over existing networking infrastructure, the internet
 being the most important.
 The blockchain industry must work towards standardization of internal component
s.
 This standardization will involve large established firms, like IBM, creating
 consensus mechanism standards, a smart contract core upon which derived
 contracts will be written, database implementation on which the ledger
 is built, and cryptographic security.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Smart Contracts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contracts are essentially agreements between two parties that contain precise
 rules about what actions are to be undertaken by whom and under which circumsta
nces.
 To establish trust between such two parties, a number of institutions facilitat
e transactions.
 Most financial industries are heavily dependent on such 'middle men'.
 The blockchain provides a trustless mechanism that can automate contracts.
 Automation of contracts would include immutability with respect to the
 contract rules.
 Once the contract rules have been agreed upon, neither party can change
 rules or renege on them.
 It also includes using third party sources to ascertain if conditions dependent
 on external factors have been met.
 Making middle men obsolete also carries with it the added advantage of
 reduced settlement times as well as reduced operational costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Smart contracts have applications in a large number of use cases beyond
 the conventional currency based transactional model that the blockchain
 is most well known for: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Public records such as land holdings, vehicle registrations, and various
 licenses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Identification such as drivers licenses, passports, and identity cards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Private records such as bets, contracts, loans, and wills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Financial transactions such as private equity, mutual funds, and derivatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Indian Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Financial Inclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last couple of years has seen the government initiate massive schemes
 like the Jan Dhan Yojna to provide the large unbanked population in India
 with financial services.
 According to a recent report by PriceWaterCoopers released last year, the
 unbanked population has halved to 233 million in 2015 from 557 million
 in 2011.
 While the numbers seem impressive, the fact that about half these added
 accounts have a balance of zero, makes this endeavor by the government
 far less successful.
 According to government sources only about 27% of villages have banking
 services readily accessible.
 The success of mPesa in Kenya and bKash in Bangladesh could point to a
 cost effective and efficient method to extend financial inclusion to all
 segments of Indian society.
 The possibility of implementing mobile banking solutions necessitates a
 more thorough analysis of which underlying technology to implement.
 Blockchain technology may be the ideal solution to build mobile banking
 infrastructure on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RBI has been making structural changes to the architecture of the banking
 industry.
 With the advent of payment banks in addition to universal banks, the RBI
 has introduced non-traditional banking institutions and might yet add more.
 All of these banking institutions will have independent mechanisms of database
 management and settlement.
 Even though the current mood in the financial world with respect to the
 application of Blockchain technology to the banking sector lies in permissioned
 or private blockchains, inter-bank settlement and ledger maintenance could
 one day be carried out on the blockchain.
 Even intra-bank settlement can benefit greatly from the distributed ledger
 architecture of the blockchain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scenarios outlined above make a compelling case for why distributed
 ledger technology, or the blockchain, is extremely relevant to the financial
 industry in India today.
 Any attempt to service the massive underbanked population via expansion
 of infrastructure would be prohibitively expensive.
 By using the blockchain as the core protocol to carry out mobile banking,
 banks in India could target these populations relatively easily.
 This is because Blockchain technology has significantly lower cost of deploymen
t, an immutable shared ledger, and robust security mechanisms.
 By reworking the service model followed by all banks today from the ground
 up, banking facilities could be served on mobile devices rather than physical
 locations resulting in massively reduced infrastructure costs.
 While financial institutions balk at the term 'shared ledger', in the permissio
ned blockchain paradigm, shared can be defined to only include the parties
 involved.
 The extent of how 'shared' the ledger is can be controlled depending on
 the use case.
 For instance the parties involved in a transaction, the payment service
 provider, and the regulatory bodies could all have access to a shared ledger
 without any other individual or institution having access.
 And finally blockchain ledgers are built upon technology derived from cryptogra
phic breakthroughs in theoretical Computer Science over the past few decades.
 Transactions between two parties are signed by digital signatures using
 cryptographic techniques and the transmission of these transactions is
 further encrypted ensuring robust digital security.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
UPI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NPCI(National Payment Corporation of India) was formed in 2009 by the
 RBI to address certain concerns it had with respect to banking infrastructure
 and public accessibility to it.
 The NPCI most recently launched the Unified Payments Interface making explicit
 three major design principles.
 The first is adoption.
 This ties in directly with the preceding section on financial inclusion.
 Innovative technology is meaningless if it is inaccessible to the masses
 or inconvenient.
 A major hurdle to accessibility of banking technology can hypothetically
 be overcome by implementing mobile banking infrastructure that can be served
 on phones.
 The second is security.
 Security at all levels of implemented technologies is paramount to the
 banking industry.
 Racked by malicious attacks, the need to protect transactional data is
 of utmost importance.
 The third is cost.
 With mobile technology so widespread, investing in mobile banking technology
 made infinitely more sense than in creating traditional banking infrastructure.
 More over operational costs of banking at large scale are significant and
 innovation to drive down those costs can result in sizable savings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How is the blockchain relevant in this scenario? Firstly, adoption of new
 technologies in regulated financial industries is always difficult.
 Innovating with technology that the banks use to serve it's customers becomes
 much easier with the creation of the UPI.
 In this context, blockchain technology can be implemented to conduct mobile
 banking transaction without regulatory hurdles.
 In other words, regulators in the banking industry are looking to evolve
 mobile banking and this provides the perfect opportunity to innovate with
 newer technologies like the blockchain.
 Secondly, date security is a paramount concern for all stakeholders in
 the banking ecosystem.
 The blockhain was designed as an open or public network and the reason
 it continues to thrive(bitcoin) is because of robust data security mechanisms.
 Running mobile banking infrastructure on the blockchain would give Indian
 banks the ability to secure transactional data better than traditional
 network security implementations.
 And finally, operational costs are greatly reduced if authentication, verificat
ion, and settlement all happen in a distributed system rather than a centralized
 one.
 It's not surprising that both NPCI and RBI have constituted committees
 to understand the blockchain better.
 However the specifics of how the blockchain gets implemented are far less
 concrete at this point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Private vs Public
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bitcoin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Private or permissioned blockchains share significant similarities with
 bitcoin.
 The state of the system is immutable in both the bitcoin blockchain and
 private blockchains.
 The general category of consensus mechanism is a BFT(Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
 algorithm.
 The specific algorithm, however, is almost guaranteed to be different because
 the consensus mechanism of proof-of-work, used in bitcoin, has limited
 usefulness in the private blockchain paradigm.
 Proof-of-work is a consensus mechanism where large processor farms carry
 out repetitive calculations to win a numeric lottery(the winning numbers
 are called the 'difficulty').
 The miner who wins the lottery is allowed to pay himself a fee and add
 his block of transactions to the blockchain.
 The reason this guarantees BFT(Byzantine Fault Tolerance) is because if
 transactions are edited within the blockchain, the network's hashing rate(which
 determines mining power) is going to be much higher than that of the individual
 miner or mining pool and therefore the 'honest' transactions are going
 to be on the longest chain of blocks.
 Admittedly this is not straightforward but takeaway from this recalls what
 was discussed in Section 1.3.1, that a significant fraction of the nodes(miners)
 must be dishonest to introduce 'wrong' transactions in the blockchain(51%
 for bitcoin).
 In the context of private blockchains, this entire process is unnecessary
 because the nodes that do the 'mining'(adding transactions to a block)
 are all known.
 This is why private is used interchangeable with permissioned in the context
 of the blockchain.
 Even though the nodes which add transactions to blocks are known/permissioned,
 the concerns discussed in Section 1.3.1 still persist.
 Robust consensus mechanisms that are Byzantine Fault Tolerant must still
 be implemented.
 The good news with doing away with proof-of-work is that the utility(latency)
 of the system is drastically improved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Smart contracts are far more powerful in private blockchain implementations.
 The bitcoin scripting language is intentionally primitive(eg.
 Turing-incomplete) and the inbuilt data frame, upon which a script is run,
 has very rigid categories.
 Mostly about quantities of bitcoin and the spending conditions.
 While some people have devised ways to encode data in some sub-fields of
 the data frame, the solutions are very inefficient and inelegant.
 Private blockchains on the other hand can have sophisticated scripting
 capabilities built in at different levels of the blockchain.
 Smart contracts defining transaction rules can be written at the level
 of the wallet implementation.
 While encoding business logic by itself is a significant improvement over
 the bitcoin smart contract abilities, the time stamping for the execution
 of the smart contract can be delinked from the timestamping at the moment
 of block creation.
 So in the case of bitcoin, a smart contract is dependent on when the block
 is mined for execution whereas in a private blockchain the smart contract
 can be encoded with execution instructions including when it must/can be
 executed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Ethereum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethereum was designed as a generalized blockchain in contrast to bitcoin.
 It is built around the idea of smart contracts and ether, which is the
 computational currency that determines how long the smart contracts run.
 Ethereum is a very technically advanced implementation of the blockchain
 and the organization is run by very good developers who are not afraid
 to experiment.
 While this mentality is very conducive for technical experimentation, there
 are significant security challenges that arise from how the ethereum ecosystem
 is set up.
 For instance developers who wish to build their applications on ethereum
 are often less conscientious about the quality of their code and can introduce
 vulnerabilities in their implementations.
 Most notably the DAO hack in recent times damaged the reputation of ethereum
 significantly.
 The DOA was shut down and the reimbursement process was extremely messy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While private implementations are possible, the ethereum blockchain is a
 public one.
 Unsurprisingly the ethereum blockchain uses the proof-of-work consensus
 mechanism.
 This is in contrast with private blockchains which typically don't use
 proof-of-work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blockchain, on closer scrutiny, reveals itself to be a collection of
 different technologies that are combined together to facilitate transactions.
 The database or ledger records all transaction and more fundamentally is
 the store of the state of the entire system.
 Network consensus mechanisms allow state transition rules to be implemented
 allowing transactions to be written on the ledger.
 There are a number of choices for the structure of the ledger, kind of
 consensus mechanism, and even the distribution of the network.
 The kind of blockchain, private or public, often makes certain design choices
 more useful than others.
 The use-case of the blockchain also affects what technologies are chosen.
 And sometimes even ideological persuasions can directly affect the technology
 stack in question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this still muddled picture emerges the conventional idea that a technology,
 or a technology stack, is only as useful as the problem it solves.
 So the focus is necessarily on identifying the problems that need a solution.
 And from this should follow the design choices that make up different blockchai
ns.
