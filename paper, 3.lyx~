Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the past few years, an important innovation colloquially known as the
 “blockchain” has emerged as a potentially disruptive technology.
 The core of the innovation is built around the concept of a distributed
 cryptographic database.
 The database, also referred to as the ledger, is maintained by a network
 of computers.
 The ledger makes it possible for the entire network to create, evolve and
 keep track of an immutable record of transactions.
 The most successful blockchain application thus far has been Satoshi Nakamoto's
 cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin, which he outlined in his seminal paper,
 “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” in 2008.
 This powerful technology has so far been been implicated in the numerous
 unregulated cyrptocurrencies that exist online.
 Financial institutions are only beginning to understand the potential applicati
ons of blockchains in conventionally regulated industries.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Distributed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blockchain is also referred to as a distributed ledger.
 This is because a large number of nodes on the blockchain network posses
 their own copy of the entire ledger.
 This creates a decentralized and distributed arrangement of nodes.
 This is an important design choice because when a block of transactions
 are ready to be uploaded onto the blockchain, the individual nodes participate
 in a voting mechanism to decide which node, called the 'leader', makes
 the addition.
 This entire process is based upon a networking paradigm derived from BFT
 or Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithms(explained below).
 All nodes in this distributed system have access to a subset of all available
 nodes and are able to re-connect and update their individual ledger in
 the case of any downtime.
 Certain groups of nodes are stable nodes and often given the label 'genesis'
 nodes to demarcate the fact that the first block was created at that particular
 node and shared with other nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Cryptographic Security
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The blockchain is designed such that transactions are created using public
 key encryption(explained below).
 Each account has a private key associated with it.
 The public key derived from the private key is used to sign transactions.
 The private key establishes ownership of the token transferred by the transacti
on.
 The use of public key encryption means that if someone were to get hold
 of the transaction data through malicious means, they would be unable to
 derive any information from it because the private key for any account
 is never exposed.
 The data stays encrypted and is of no use to the attacker.
 There is a second layer of SSL encryption that transfers the transaction
 data between nodes.
 So complete privacy is guaranteed at both the level of transaction data
 as well as the transmission of the transaction data.
 Any entities who must be able to lawfully decrypt the data can be permissioned
 appropriately.
 This could include the payment service players(PSPs), auditors, or agencies
 involved in anti money laundering monitoring.

Byzantine Fault Tolerance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Byzantine fault tolerance is a property of computer systems that are faced
 with failures resulting from the Byzantine General's 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Byzantine General's Problem refers to a problem with achieving consensus
 between participants.
 The problem statement is that a number of generals of the Byzantine army
 must coordinate their movements on the battlefield.
 The options available to them is 'attack' or 'retreat'.
 The idea being that a coordinated 'attack' or 'retreat' is better than
 some generals attacking and being defeated and some retreating.
 The circumstances are complicated because the generals are separated from
 each other and must send messages to each other.
 In the case where there are nine generals and four apiece vote for 'retreat'
 and 'attack', the ninth general can vote for a losing strategy or perhaps
 send different messages to either group.
 This analogy holds well for nodes in a distributed network and to help
 envision strategies to create robust fault tolerance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us considers the scenario of three generals A, B, and C, and their exchange
 of messages.
 If we suppose that A is malicious and sends conflicting messages to both
 B and C, then it is impossible for B and C to determine who the traitor
 is given that they can communicate with each other.
 One conclusion to draw from this is that the number of nodes that are faulty
 must be less than a third of the total nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of implementations of Byzantine Fault Tolerance in practice
 today.
 Proof-of-work is a very well established implementation of Byzantine Fault
 Tolerance used in public blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
 A derivative of the network consensus algorithm Raft hardened with fault
 tolerance has been designed by the JP Morgan team which created the permissione
d blockchain called Juno.
 The Ripple consensus algorithm is another implementation of Byzantine Fault
 Tolerance in the context of permissioned blockchains used notably by Intel
 Sawtooth blockchain.

Financial Inclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last couple of years has seen the government initiate massive schemes
 like the Jan Dhan Yojna to provide the large unbanked population in India
 with financial services.
 According to a recent report by PriceWaterCoopers released last year, the
 unbanked population has halved to 233 million in 2015 from 557 million
 in 2011.
 While the numbers seem impressive, the fact that about half these added
 accounts have a balance of zero, makes this endevor by the government far
 less successful.
 According to government sources only about 27% of villages have banking
 services readily accessible.
 The success of mPesa in Kenya and bKash in Bangladesh could point to a
 cost effective and efficient method to extend financial inclusion to all
 segments of Indian society.
 The possibility of implementing mobile banking solutions necessitates a
 more thorough analysis of which underlying technology to implement.
 Blockchain technology would be an ideal protocol to set up the new age
 mobile banking technology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RBI has been making structural changes to the architecture of the banking
 industry.
 With the advent of payment banks in addition to universal banks, the RBI
 may introduce other banking institutions like custodian and wholesale banks.
 All of these banking institutions will have independent mechanisms of database
 management and settlement.
 Even though the current mood in the financial world with respect to the
 application of Blockchain technology to the banking sector lies in permissioned
 or private blockchains, inter-bank settlement and ledger maintenance could
 one day be carried out on the blockchain.
 Even intra-bank settlement can benefit greatly from the distributed ledger
 architecture of the blockchain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scenarios outlined above make a compelling case for why distributed
 ledger technology, or the blockchain, is extremely relevant to the financial
 industry in India today.
 Any attempt to service the massive underbanked population via expansion
 of infrastructure would be prohibitively expensive.
 Using the blockchain as the core protocol to carry out mobile banking,
 banks in India today could target these populations relatively easily.
 This is because Blockchain technology has significantly lower cost of deploymen
t, an immutable shared ledger, and robust security mechanisms.
 By reworking the service model followed by all banks today from the ground
 up, banking facilities could be served on mobile devices rather than physical
 locations resulting in massively reduced infrastructure costs.
 While financial institutions balk at the term 'shared ledger', in the permissio
ned blockchain paradigm, shared can be defined to only include the parties
 involved.
 The extent of how 'shared' the ledger is can be controlled depending on
 the use case.
 For instance the parties involved in a transaction, the payment service
 provider, and the regulatory bodies could all have access to a shared ledger
 without any other individual or institution having access.
 And finally blockchain ledgers are built upon technology derived from cryptogra
phic breakthroughs in theoretical Computer Science over the past few decades.
 Transactions between two parties are signed by digital signatures using
 cryptographic techniques and the transmission of these transactions is
 further encrypted.
